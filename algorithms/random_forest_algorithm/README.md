### `random_forest.py` - The Ensemble Engine 🌲

Our main implementation contains:

```python
# 🎲 Bootstrap sampling - creates diverse training sets
def bootstrap_sample(X, Y):
    n_samples = X.shape[0]
    idxs = np.random.choice(n_samples, size=n_samples, replace=True)
    return X[idxs], Y[idxs]

# 🗳️ Democratic voting - finds most common prediction
def most_common(Y):
    counter = Counter(Y)
    most_common = counter.most_common(1)[0][0]
    return most_common

# 🌲 The Random Forest classifier - ensemble of decision trees
class RandomForest:
    def __init__(self, n_trees=100, max_depth=10, min_samples_split=2, n_feats=None):
        self.n_trees = n_trees                    # Number of trees in the forest
        self.max_depth = max_depth                # Maximum depth for each tree
        self.min_samples_split = min_samples_split # Minimum samples to split a node
        self.n_feats = n_feats                    # Number of features to consider per split
        self.trees = []                           # List to store all trees
    
    def fit(self, X, Y):
        self.trees = []
        for _ in range(self.n_trees):
            # 🌱 Create a new decision tree
            tree = DecisionTree(max_depth=self.max_depth, 
                              min_samples_split=self.min_samples_split, 
                              n_feats=self.n_feats)
            
            # 🎲 Create a bootstrap sample (random sampling with replacement)
            X_sample, Y_sample = bootstrap_sample(X, Y)
            
            # 🌳 Train the tree on this unique sample
            tree.fit(X_sample, Y_sample)
            self.trees.append(tree)
    
    def predict(self, X):
        # 🔮 Get predictions from all trees
        tree_preds = [tree.predict(X) for tree in self.trees]
        
        # 🔄 Reshape predictions for voting
        tree_preds = np.swapaxes(tree_preds, 1, 0)
        
        # 🗳️ Vote for final prediction (majority wins!)
        model_pred = np.array([most_common(tree_pred) for tree_pred in tree_preds])
        return model_pred
```

### `random_forest_test.py` - Forest vs Cancer! 🏥

Our test script demonstrates the ensemble power:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    accuracy = np.sum(y_true == y_pred) / len(y_true)
    return accuracy

# 🔬 Load real medical data - breast cancer dataset
data = datasets.load_breast_cancer()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# 📊 Split data for proper evaluation
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=1234)

# 🌲 Create Random Forest with 3 trees for demonstration
clf = RandomForest(n_trees=3, max_depth=10, min_samples_split=2, n_feats=None)

# 💪 Train the forest
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 🔮 Make ensemble predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
acc = accuracy(y_test, y_pred)

print("Accuracy:", acc)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run the Test

```bash
# Navigate to the Random Forest directory
cd algorithms/random_forest_algorithm

# Run the test script
python random_forest_test.py
```

**Expected Output:** `Accuracy: 0.89473684210526632` (about 89% accuracy! 🎉)

### 2. Use In Your Own Code

```python
import numpy as np
from random_forest import RandomForest
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load your data
X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create Random Forest classifier
forest_classifier = RandomForest(n_trees=10, max_depth=8, n_feats=5)

# Train the forest
forest_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = forest_classifier.predict(X_test)

print(f"Predictions: {predictions}")
```

## 🧠 How Random Forest Works (The Ensemble Magic!)

### The Big Picture 🎯

Random Forest combines the wisdom of multiple decision trees:

```
🌲 Tree 1 (trained on sample A, features [1,3,5,7])    → Prediction: Benign
🌳 Tree 2 (trained on sample B, features [2,4,6,8])    → Prediction: Malignant  
🌲 Tree 3 (trained on sample C, features [1,2,6,9])    → Prediction: Benign

🗳️ VOTING: 2 Benign vs 1 Malignant → Final: BENIGN
```

### Step-by-Step Ensemble Process

1. **🎲 Bootstrap Sampling (Bagging)**
   ```python
   def bootstrap_sample(X, Y):
       n_samples = X.shape[0]
       idxs = np.random.choice(n_samples, size=n_samples, replace=True)
       return X[idxs], Y[idxs]
   ```
   - Creates diverse training sets by sampling **with replacement**
   - Each tree sees slightly different data
   - Reduces overfitting through diversity

2. **🌱 Tree Training with Feature Randomness**
   ```python
   # Each tree considers only a random subset of features
   tree = DecisionTree(n_feats=sqrt(total_features))  # Common choice
   tree.fit(X_sample, Y_sample)
   ```

3. **🔮 Ensemble Prediction**
   ```python
   # Get predictions from all trees
   tree_preds = [tree.predict(X) for tree in self.trees]
   
   # Vote for final prediction
   final_pred = [most_common(predictions) for predictions in tree_preds]
   ```

4. **🗳️ Democratic Voting**
   ```python
   def most_common(Y):
       counter = Counter(Y)
       return counter.most_common(1)[0][0]  # Return most frequent class
   ```

### 🎲 Bootstrap Sampling Explained

**Bootstrap Sampling** creates diversity in the forest:

```
Original Dataset: [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H]

Sample 1: [A, B, B, E, F, G, H, H]  ← Some duplicates, some missing
Sample 2: [A, A, C, D, D, E, G, H]  ← Different combination
Sample 3: [B, C, C, D, F, F, F, H]  ← Yet another combination
```

**Each tree trains on ~63.2% unique samples** (mathematical property of bootstrap sampling)

### 🔀 Feature Randomness

At each split, each tree considers only a **random subset** of features:

```
Total Features: [radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, ...]

Tree 1 considers: [radius, area, smoothness]      ← Random subset
Tree 2 considers: [texture, perimeter, area]      ← Different subset  
Tree 3 considers: [radius, texture, smoothness]   ← Another subset
```

**Common choices for number of features:**
- **Classification**: `sqrt(total_features)`
- **Regression**: `total_features / 3`
- **Custom**: Any number you choose

## 📊 Real-World Performance

### 🏥 Breast Cancer Dataset Results

Our Random Forest achieves **~89% accuracy** on cancer diagnosis!

**Dataset Details:**
- **Samples:** 569 patients
- **Features:** 30 (tumor characteristics)
- **Classes:** 2 (Malignant vs Benign)
- **Test Split:** 20% (114 samples for testing)
- **Forest Size:** 3 trees (configurable)

### 🌲 Forest vs Single Tree Comparison

```python
# Single Decision Tree
single_tree = DecisionTree(max_depth=10)
single_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
single_accuracy = accuracy(y_test, single_tree.predict(X_test))

# Random Forest (3 trees)
random_forest = RandomForest(n_trees=3, max_depth=10)
random_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)
forest_accuracy = accuracy(y_test, random_forest.predict(X_test))

print(f"Single Tree: {single_accuracy:.3f}")
print(f"Random Forest: {forest_accuracy:.3f}")
```

**Typical Results:**
- **Single Tree**: ~90% (can overfit)
- **Random Forest**: ~89% (more robust, less overfitting)

## 🔬 Understanding the Code

### Why This Implementation Rocks

1. **🎲 True Bootstrap Sampling**
   ```python
   # Creates diverse datasets for each tree
   idxs = np.random.choice(n_samples, size=n_samples, replace=True)
   return X[idxs], Y[idxs]
   ```

2. **🌳 Leverages Our Decision Tree**
   ```python
   # Reuses our custom DecisionTree implementation
   tree = DecisionTree(max_depth=self.max_depth, 
                      min_samples_split=self.min_samples_split, 
                      n_feats=self.n_feats)
   ```

3. **🗳️ Democratic Voting System**
   ```python
   # Clear, interpretable majority voting
   tree_preds = [tree.predict(X) for tree in self.trees]
   final_pred = [most_common(pred) for pred in tree_preds]
   ```

4. **⚙️ Highly Configurable**
   ```python
   # All hyperparameters are adjustable
   RandomForest(n_trees=100,      # Number of trees
                max_depth=10,     # Tree complexity
                min_samples_split=2,  # Split criteria
                n_feats=None)     # Feature randomness
   ```


**What you'll see:**
- `1 tree`: Variable accuracy (single tree performance)
- `3 trees`: Good improvement from ensemble
- `10 trees`: Better and more stable
- `20 trees`: Diminishing returns, but very stable

## 💡 When to Use Random Forest

### ✅ Random Forest Works Great For:
- **Almost any classification problem** (very versatile)
- **Noisy datasets** (robust to outliers)
- **Missing feature values** (can handle with modifications)
- **Feature importance analysis** (can rank feature usefulness)
- **When you need good performance quickly** (often works well out-of-the-box)
- **Mixed data types** (numerical and categorical features)
- **Medium to large datasets** (scales well)

### ❌ Random Forest Struggles With:
- **Very small datasets** (ensemble overhead not worth it)
- **Linear relationships** (simpler models might be better)
- **Real-time predictions** (slower than single models)
- **Memory constraints** (stores multiple trees)
- **Highly correlated features** (all trees might make similar mistakes)

## 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning

### Number of Trees (`n_trees`)
```python
# Too few (1-2): No ensemble benefit
# Just right (10-100): Good balance of performance and speed
# Too many (1000+): Diminishing returns, slower prediction
```

### Maximum Depth (`max_depth`)
```python
# Too shallow (3): Each tree underfits
# Just right (10): Good balance
# Too deep (None): Each tree overfits, but ensemble helps
```

### Number of Features (`n_feats`)
```python
# All features (None): Less randomness, might overfit
# Square root (√n): Standard choice for classification
# Custom: Experiment to find sweet spot
```

### Minimum Samples Split (`min_samples_split`)
```python
# Too small (2): Trees can overfit to noise
# Just right (5-10): Good generalization
# Too large (50+): Trees underfit
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Poor Accuracy (<70%)**
   ```python
   # Try more trees
   forest = RandomForest(n_trees=20)
   
   # Try deeper trees
   forest = RandomForest(max_depth=15)
   
   # Check data quality
   print("Class distribution:", np.bincount(y))
   ```

2. **Slow Training/Prediction**
   ```python
   # Reduce number of trees
   forest = RandomForest(n_trees=5)
   
   # Limit tree depth
   forest = RandomForest(max_depth=8)
   
   # Use feature sampling
   forest = RandomForest(n_feats=10)
   ```

3. **Import Errors**
   ```python
   # Make sure decision_tree.py is in the same directory
   # Or add proper import path
   from decision_tree import DecisionTree
   ```

## 📊 Mathematical Deep Dive

### Bootstrap Sampling Probability
```
P(sample not selected in one draw) = (n-1)/n
P(sample not selected in n draws) = ((n-1)/n)^n
As n→∞: P(sample not selected) → 1/e ≈ 0.368
Therefore: P(sample selected) ≈ 0.632
```

### Ensemble Variance Reduction
```
If individual models have variance σ²:
Ensemble variance = σ²/n (for independent models)
Random Forest achieves partial independence through randomness
```

### Majority Voting Decision
```
For binary classification with n trees:
Prediction = 1 if Σ(tree_predictions) > n/2, else 0
```
